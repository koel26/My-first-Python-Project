Project 1:

Write a Python program to check the sum of three elements (each from an array) from three arrays is equal to a target value. Print all those three-element combinations.

Sample data:
/*
X = [10, 20, 20, 20]
Y = [10, 20, 30, 40]
Z = [10, 30, 40, 20]
target = 70
*/

Project 2:

Write a Python program to create all possible permutations from a given collection of distinct numbers.
